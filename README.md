# Lambda Foundations

## Module 3 - CSS - Box Model

### Module 3 Project

Today we learned about the core languages of every webpage, HTML and CSS. In this project, we are going to practice both of those languages.
In this project, we are going to mimic the Lambda School Alumni page (you can find that here: https://lambdaschool.com/profiles). We want you to create your own profile. Don't worry this won't be made public, it's just a fun exercise for now. One day you will have your own profile on that page.

### Getting Started

In order to get started you will need to download this project as a .zip file and open it in VS Code (like Module 1). Here are the instructions to do so:

1. Click on the Green button that says Code in the upper right-hand side of the screen.
2. You will see an option at the bottom called Download Zip.
3. You will need to find the place the .zip file is downloaded to. This will usually be the Downloads folder on your computer. Tip: if you are using Chrome, you should be able to click on the download itself in the bottom left-hand corner of your browse, this will open the location of the downloaded file in My Computer or Finder.
4. Double-click on the .zip file itself. Once you unzip the file you should see a Folder or Directory with the name "Foundations_Module_1_proj" next to the .zip file.
5. Either drag and drop the entire folder onto the VS Code icon, OR open VS Code -> click on File > Open -> Find the folder from step 4 -> Click open.
6. Open the index.html file in your browser. In most cases you can drag and drop the HTML file directly to your open browser screen.

### Analyze the Code

Before you open the project, one thing to note. A LOT of code has already been written. This may be overwhelming at first, that's OK! Take a moment and just analyze the code that has already been written. Are there elements that you recognize? Are there elements that you've never seen before? Take note of these things. A major skill in software development is learning to read the code that is already there and figuring out where to insert your own code. We've done that step for you today but as an exercise try and answer the questions below:

1. In `index.html`, replace "Your Name" with your actual name.

2. In `index.css`, on line 53 what do each of the numbers represent for the margin?

5. In `index.css`, on which line is the total price of the binoculars (`index.html` line 57) being styled?

### Try it out

For this try it out exercise you will be focusing your attention on `index.css` and making sure the page is properlly spaced, and borders look correct. You can find instuctions on where to start on line 260. You can also use the following image as a guide. One note: there are many ways to acheive the same style in CSS. Often times spacing can be the most difficult part of writing CSS. Don't get overwhelmed thinking about the entire project as a whole. This is a fantastic opportunity to practice breaking down a large problem into much smaller manageable bits. So, take your time and focus on one peice at a time.

### Go further

In this section, we'd like you to take your learning into your own hands! It is an important skill to be able to find the answers you are seeking on the internet while working on a software project. In today's case, we've helped you out a bit. Below we've listed a few popular resources when researching Web Development.

### In Your Own Words

An impactful technique in learning something new is attempting to reiterate the concepts you just learned from memory in your own words. This allows you to highlight areas you are not comfortable with and could study on a little more. We'll start this exercise off pretty simply. Just remember that this is merely an exercise, there are no right or wrong answers here. Please answer the following question in your own words

1. Name the 4 parts of the box model and what each means.
